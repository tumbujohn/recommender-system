# Project Structure and Approach: Feynman Explainer so that I and other really understand what I am doing.

## What is This Project?
This project is about building a recommender system using collaborative filtering. Think of it as a smart assistant that learns what you like (movies, products, etc.) by looking at what you and others have enjoyed in the past, and then suggests new things you might love.

## How is the Project Organized?

Imagine your project as a well-organized toolbox, where each compartment has a clear purpose:

```
recommender-system/
│
├── data/                # Where you keep your raw and processed datasets
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for exploring and playing with data
├── src/                 # The brains: all the code that does the work
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── data_loader.py   # Code to fetch and load your data
│   ├── preprocess.py    # Code to clean and prepare your data
│   ├── models.py        # Where the recommendation magic happens
│   ├── evaluation.py    # Code to check how good your recommendations are
│   └── main.py          # The main switch to run your system
├── tests/               # Safety checks: code to make sure everything works
├── .docs/               # All your notes, explanations, and reference files
├── requirements.txt     # A shopping list of all the Python tools you need
├── README.md            # A quick guide to your project
└── .gitignore           # Tells git what to ignore
```

## Step-by-Step Approach (Explained Simply)

### 1. Data Handling
- **What?** Store your dataset (like MovieLens) in the `data/` folder.
- **Why?** You need data to learn from! `data_loader.py` helps you fetch this data into your code.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **What?** Use Jupyter notebooks to look at your data, make charts, and spot patterns.
- **Why?** Like a detective, you want to understand what’s in your data before you start building.

### 3. Preprocessing
- **What?** Clean up the data: fix missing values, normalize ratings, split into training and testing sets.
- **Why?** Clean data is like clean ingredients in cooking—better results!

### 4. Model Development
- **What?** Build the actual recommender using collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based).
- **Why?** This is the core engine that figures out what to recommend, based on similarities between users or items.

### 5. Evaluation
- **What?** Use metrics like RMSE, precision, recall, and F1-score to check how well your system works.
- **Why?** You want to know if your recommendations are actually good!

### 6. Experimentation & Iteration
- **What?** Try different approaches, tune settings, and solve problems like the cold-start issue.
- **Why?** Like a scientist, you experiment to find what works best.

### 7. Testing
- **What?** Write tests to make sure your code does what it’s supposed to do.
- **Why?** This keeps your project reliable and bug-free.

### 8. Documentation
- **What?** Write down your methods, findings, and instructions in `.docs/` and `README.md`.
- **Why?** Good notes help you (and others) understand and improve the project later.

## Feynman Technique: Explaining Like You’re Five

- **Imagine you’re teaching a friend:**
  - "We want to build a system that helps people find things they’ll like, by learning from what they and others have liked before."
  - "We organize our work so that every part has a job: some parts get the data, some clean it, some make predictions, and some check if those predictions are good."
  - "We keep notes and tests so we don’t get lost and can always check if we’re on the right track."

- **If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.**
  - This structure and approach make sure you (and anyone else) can always understand what’s happening, why, and how to improve it.

## Summary
This project is like building a smart friend who learns from everyone’s choices and helps you discover new favorites. By keeping everything organized and explained simply, you make sure your project is powerful, reliable, and easy to grow.

## More concepts for my reference
 The predicted rating (see notbook - the eda (exploratory data analysis notebook and the web_demo.py)) is an estimated score that the recommender system calculates for a movie that a user has not yet rated. It represents how much the system thinks the user would like that movie, based on collaborative filtering.

For user-based collaborative filtering, the predicted rating is typically computed by looking at ratings given to the movie by users who are similar to the target user, and averaging (or weighting) those ratings by similarity.

For item-based collaborative filtering, it is computed by looking at how the user rated similar movies, and averaging (or weighting) those ratings by item similarity.
