Here are some valuable next steps to further enhance this recommender system:

1. **Optimize Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:**
   - Use vectorized operations (NumPy, pandas) to speed up similarity calculations.
   - Limit the number of similar items considered (e.g., top-N) to reduce computation.
   - Consider using sparse matrices for large datasets.

2. **Enhance the Streamlit Web Demo:**
   - Add more real-world scenarios (e.g., cold start, new user/item).
   - Allow users to upload their own ratings or select favorite genres.
   - Add visualizations (e.g., similarity heatmaps, recommendation explanations).

3. **Expand Documentation:**
   - Add a "Troubleshooting" section for common issues.
   - Include a "Performance Tips" section.
   - Provide more detailed usage examples in the README.

4. **Advanced Features (Optional):**
   - Implement hybrid methods (combine user/item-based with content-based).
   - Add implicit feedback support (e.g., clicks, views).
   - Integrate with a database for persistent user profiles.
